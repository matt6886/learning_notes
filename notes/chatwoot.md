### react-redux

Redux is a pattern and library for managing and updating global application state, where the UI triggers events called 'actions' to describe what happened, and separate updating logic called 'reducers' updates the state in response.

#### When should we use Redux?

- You have large amount of application state that are needed in many places in the app
- The app state is frequently updated over time
- The logic to update the state may be complex
- The app has medium or large-sized codebase, and might be worked on by many people

**In a React + Redux app, your global state should go in the Redux store, and your local state should stay in React components.**

#### Teminology

- Actions
- Action creators
- Reducers
- Store
- Dispatch
- Selector
